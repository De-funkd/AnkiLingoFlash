## How It Works

AnkiLingoFlash leverages large language models (like the one behind ChatGPT) to play with words in order to generate mnemonics to enrich your flashcards. It's designed to turn your daily browsing into an effortless learning opportunity.

## Getting Started

1. Install AnkiLingoFlash ([Chrome](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ankilingoflash/hicnjnfcmjfnomdfmekhigghmlkmachb) / [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ankilingoflash/))
2. Set up Anki-Connect and AwesomeTTS (full guide on [ankilingoflash.com](https://ankilingoflash.com/getting-started/quick-tutorial/))
3. Start creating flashcards as you browse!

## Open Source & Future Plans

AnkiLingoFlash is an open-source project, and developers are encouraged to contribute! Check out the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/pictoune/AnkiLingoFlash).

The extension is currently available for Chrome and Firefox, with Edge support coming soon. In the future, I hope to make it completely free by utilizing AI models that run directly on users' computers.

## Affordable and Efficient

After the free trial, you can use your own OpenAI API key. Using gpt-4o-mini (a much cheaper model than gpt-4o and almost as performant), you can generate thousands of flashcards for about $1.

I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback. Has anyone else experimented with AI-enhanced Anki workflows for language learning? What has been your experience?

Happy learning! 📚✨
