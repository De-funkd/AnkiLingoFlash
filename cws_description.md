üìö Anki uses spaced repetition to enhance learning, but creating a quality deck of flashcards can be time-consuming. Fortunately, AnkiLingoFlash is here to simplify the process! Once installed, AnkiLingoFlash allows you to generate flashcards from any word or phrase you select on a webpage. The front of the flashcard features a definition and direct translation, while the back includes the selected term, three example sentences, and a mnemonic ‚Äî all AI-generated.

‚ú® How It Works:
1. Select text and right-click: Highlight a word or phrase, right-click, and choose the option to generate a flashcard.
2. Review the flashcard: Check the definition, direct translation, example sentences, and mnemonic. You can regenerate any part of the flashcard or edit it manually if needed.
3. Choose the deck: Select the Anki deck to add your new flashcard to, and you're done!
